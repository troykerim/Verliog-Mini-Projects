# Verliog Mini Projects


## Overview
This repo will contain an assorment various digital logic circuits implemented in Verilog for quick reference.  
Each folder will contain associated files for a particular project and will include the test bench, console output, schematic and waveforms.
The goal of this repo is to not only demostrate that I have an understanding of Verilog and digital logic but also as a quick reference repo for common circuits.
